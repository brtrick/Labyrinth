Designed by Swiss mathematician Blaise MÃ¼ller, Quarto is a challenging logic game for two players. This version is built using vanilla javascript and the threejs library.

## Overview  
Game components consist of a board and 16 playing pieces. Each piece has four attributes: 

        1. size (tall or short)  
        2. shape (square or circular)  
        3. color (dark or light)  
        4. solidity (hollow or solid)  

The game begins with an empty board. Play proceeds with the two players alternately placing pieces on the board, trying to construct a row/column/diagonal of four pieces with at least one shared attribute (e.g., all tall). The catch? The piece each player must place on the board is chosen by their opponent.  
  
## Game Play
Play begins with Player 2 selecting a piece for Player 1 to place. Once selected, the piece will appear in Player 1's Pieces to Play window. Player 1 then plays the piece by clicking a circle on the board. Player 1 next selects a piece for Player 2. Play continues in this fashion until one player forms a winning row/col/diag of 4 pieces or all the pieces have been played.

Players may rotate the board to get a better view by clicking on the board and moving the mouse:

Players may also move the pieces in the Pieces to Play windows:
