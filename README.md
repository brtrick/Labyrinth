Labyrinth

1. Background and Overview
Manipulate the board to move the ball through the maze without falling into any holes.

2. Functionality and MVPs
In Labyrinth, users will be able to:
    I. see a beautifully rendered 3D labyrinth with ball
    II. use arrow keys / WASD to tilt the board and make the ball move
    III. adjust factors like gravity, friction, and mass of the ball
    IV. use practice mode where the ball will not drop into the holes
    V. Bonus: create their own labyrinth by placing barriers and holes on a board

4. Architecture and Technology
    I will use babylonjs and one of their physics engines to create and animate the board and ball.
