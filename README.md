# Quarto  

## 1. Background and Overview  
Designed by Swiss mathematician Blaise MÃ¼ller, Quarto is a logic game for two players that consists of a board and 16 playing pieces. Each piece has four attributes:   
    1. size (tall or short)  
    2. shape (square or circular)  
    3. color (dark or light)  
    4. solidity (hollow or solid)  
Play proceeds with the two players alternately placing pieces on the board trying to construct a row of four elements with a shared attribute. The catch? The opponent chooses the piece that each player must place on the board.  
  
## 2. Functionality and MVPs
In Quarto, users will be able to:  
    1. view the board and pieces in 3D  
    2. use a mouse to select a piece for their opponent / place a piece on the board  
    3. see if their piece placement wins the game    
    4. play against a computer opponent  
    5. Bonus: graphic-based tutorial  
    6. Bonus: implement sockets with small backend to allow users to play over the web
